# Zettel Generator

![CI](https://github.com/groovytron/generator-zettel/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)

This generator allows you to generate «zettels» for your Zettelkasten. If you don't know what a Zettelkasten is, have a look at [this article](https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125).

## Requirements

The following softwares need to be installed on your system to be able to use this generator:

- Node.js (12.x or greater)

## Installation

This generator can be installed locally to your project (or zettelkasten) by running `npm install generator-zettel`. You can also install it globally by running `npm install --global generator-zettel`.

## Usage

Run `yo zettel --help` to display the generator's help. If you simply run the generator with `yo zettel` without any arguments, it will prompt for the necessary information required to generate the zettel file.

The name convention for the generated zettel is `<date-and-time>-<normalized_title>.md`. YAML metadata (`title` and `tags`) are automatically generated based on the user's input. `links` is left empty to be filled by the user.

## Output

By running the generator with `yo zettel 'Zettel generated by the generator', 'zettel,generator'`, you will get [this result](examples/20200523181543-zettel_generated_by_the_generator.md);
